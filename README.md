## About Me

Boris - passionate about logistics and coding, and residing in the vibrant city of Sofia, Bulgaria. My journey into the world of logistics was an unexpected adventure, catalyzed by connections and friendships, while my intrigue toward coding has been a lingering flame since my IT-focused middle school days. 

Cooperation and collaboration with teams energize me, offering a fulfilling experience when creating and executing tasks. My passion particularly shines through in moments where I can merge logical, technology-driven solutions with the intricate, dynamic world of logistics. I am driven by a goal to intertwine programming and logistics, exploring fields where demand and innovation intersect.

Outside of my professional sphere, I find joy in driving, working out, gaming, and hiking - activities that offer a blend of tranquility, excitement, and physical wellness. My technical journey, sparked by a childhood fascination with computers, has meandered through various paths of life, now bringing me back to a keen focus on programming, where I am diligently expanding my skills in JavaScript and exploring the endless possibilities within the realm of tech.
